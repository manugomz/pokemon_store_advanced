# Pokémon Store

This is an individual project created as a basic Vainilla Javascript, CSS and HTML project.

The page is completely responsive, has a dark mode feature and fetches [Pokéapi](https://pokeapi.co/).
The information fetched is used to create pokemon cards with all the information of each Pokémon. The cards can also be filtered by the type of Pokémon.



Let's keep in touch!
